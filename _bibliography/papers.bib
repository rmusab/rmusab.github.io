    abstract = {This paper presents a comparative analysis of different optimization techniques for the K-means algorithm in the context of big data. K-means is a widely used clustering algorithm, but it can suffer from scalability issues when dealing with large datasets. The paper explores different approaches to overcome these issues, including parallelization, approximation, and sampling methods. The authors evaluate the performance of these techniques on various benchmark datasets and compare them in terms of speed, quality of clustering, and scalability according to the LIMA dominance criterion. The results show that different techniques are more suitable for different types of datasets and provide insights into the trade-offs between speed and accuracy in K-means clustering for big data. Overall, the paper offers a comprehensive guide for practitioners and researchers on how to optimize K-means for big data applications.},

    abstract = {This study presents an analysis conducted on a real-world dataset of Java vulnerability-fixing commits. The dataset consists of commits with varying numbers of modified methods, leading to a natural partitioning based on the number of changed functions. The research aims to address several key questions. Firstly, the study investigates the optimal parameter selection for ReVeal, a state-of-the-art model, in order to achieve its best performance. Secondly, it explores the contributions of different parts of the Java dataset towards vulnerability detection. Lastly, the study evaluates the model's performance in separating close-to-vulnerable methods (vulnerable methods and their fixed versions) from randomly selected safe code, as well as the finer separation of vulnerable methods from their fixed versions within the set of close-to-vulnerable methods. The research employs a series of experiments to answer these questions and derive meaningful insights.},

    abstract = {K-means plays a vital role in data mining and is the simplest and most widely used algorithm under the Euclidean Minimum Sum-of-Squares Clustering (MSSC) model. However, its performance drastically drops when applied to vast amounts of data. Therefore, it is crucial to improve K-means by scaling it to big data using as few of the following computational resources as possible: data, time, and algorithmic ingredients. We propose a new parallel scheme of using K-means and K-means++ algorithms for big data clustering that satisfies the properties of a “true big data” algorithm and outperforms the classical and recent state-of-the-art MSSC approaches in terms of solution quality and runtime. The new approach naturally implements global search by decomposing the MSSC problem without using additional metaheuristics. This work shows that data decomposition is the basic approach to solve the big data clustering problem. The empirical success of the new algorithm allowed us to challenge the common belief that more data is required to obtain a good clustering solution. Moreover, the present work questions the established trend that more sophisticated hybrid approaches and algorithms are required to obtain a better clustering solution.},

We base our solution on the Q-learning algorithm with action-value approximation. In contrast with other studies in the field, we use the queue length in adddition to the average delay as a measure of performance. Also, the number of queuing vehicles and the green phase duration in four directions are aggregated to represent a state. The duration of phases is a precise value for the nonconflicting directions. Therefore, cycle length is non-fixed. Finally, we analyze and update the equilibrium and queue reduction terms in our previous equation of an immediate reward. Also, the delay based reward is tested in the given control system. The performance of the proposed method is compared with an optimal symmetric fixed signal plan.},

Once the border of an object is detected the position of its approximate mass centre may be easily obtained. That coordinate is considered within 2D frame image coming directly from the camera and is subsequently projected to the reference frame associated with the real world by making use of the pinhole camera model and homogeneous coordinates. Given appropriate real world coordinates of the object (which is believed to be put onto a flat plane) iterative Jacobian inverse method provides efficient solution to the problem of inverse kinematics. Thus derived solution is sent to the Arduino microcontroller which in its turn rotates servo joints of the arm by means of the pulse-width modulation (PWM) technique.},
