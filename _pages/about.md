I am a [Ph.D. candidate in mathematics](https://math.washington.edu/people/ravil-mussabayev) working on the algorithmic foundations of computer science: pattern mining in big data, data science, global optimization, and natural language processing.

I am also working as an AI researcher in the Moscow Software Development Tools Cloud Technology Lab at the Huawei Russian Research Institute (Moscow, Russia). I specialize in conceiving, developing, enhancing, and deploying advanced deep learning models – encompassing transformers, graph neural networks, and large language models (LLMs). My focus revolves around addressing fundamental challenges related to code refactoring, as well as vulnerability and malware detection (cybersecurity), primarily in the Java and C++ programming languages.

As a lifelong learner with passions spanning from theology to computer science, I regularly share [essays (blog posts)]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/) on the beauty and intricacies of topics that shape our understanding of the world. I also post shorter, daily reflections in Russian on my Telegram channel: ["Богословские исследования. Душеполезная философия"](https://t.me/ravil_mussabayev). Feel free to explore my writings or join the conversation on Telegram. I would love to connect with fellow thinkers and enthusiasts!
