I hold a [Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)](https://math.washington.edu/people/ravil-mussabayev) degree in Mathematics from the University of Washington. I work on the algorithmic foundations of computer science: clustering, pattern mining in big data, global optimization, metaheuristics, and natural language processing.

Currently, I am working as an AI researcher in the Moscow Software Development Tools Cloud Technology Lab at the Huawei Russian Research Institute (Moscow, Russia). Here I develop and deploy advanced deep learning models, including transformers, graph neural networks, and large language models (LLMs), to tackle fundamental challenges in context-aware code tasks, such as code generation, vulnerability detection, and malware detection in Java and C++ source code.

As a lifelong learner with passions spanning from theology to computer science, I regularly share [essays (blog posts)]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/) on the beauty and intricacies of topics that shape our understanding of the world. I also post shorter, daily reflections in Russian on my Telegram channel: ["Богословские исследования. Душеполезная философия"](https://t.me/ravil_mussabayev). Feel free to explore my writings or join the conversation on Telegram. I would love to connect with fellow thinkers and enthusiasts!
