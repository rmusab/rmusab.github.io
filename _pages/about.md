I am a [Ph.D. candidate in mathematics](https://math.washington.edu/people/ravil-mussabayev) working on the algorithmic foundations of computer science: pattern mining in big data, data science, global optimization, and natural language processing.

I am also working as an AI researcher in the Moscow Software Development Tools Cloud Technology Lab at the Huawei Russian Research Institute (Moscow, Russia). I specialize in conceiving, developing, enhancing, and deploying advanced deep learning models – encompassing transformers, graph neural networks, and large language models (LLMs). My focus revolves around addressing fundamental challenges related to code refactoring and vulnerability detection (cybersecurity), primarily in the Java and C++ programming languages.

Occasionally, I enjoy writing [essays (blog posts)]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/) about science, philosophy, travelling, and everything else in the world that I find beautiful and interesting. Also, I try to share my short thoughts daily in the following Russian Telegram channel: ["Богословие на каждый день. Душеполезная философия"](https://t.me/ravil_mussabayev).
