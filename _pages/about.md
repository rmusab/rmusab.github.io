I am a Ph.D. candidate in mathematics working on the algorithmic foundations of computer science: pattern mining in big data, data science, global optimization, and natural language processing.

I am also working as an AI researcher in the Moscow Software Development Tools Cloud Technology Lab at the Huawei Russian Research Institute (Moscow, Russia). I specialize in conceiving, developing, enhancing, and deploying advanced deep learning models â€“ encompassing transformers, graph neural networks, and large language models (LLMs). My focus revolves around addressing fundamental challenges related to code refactoring and vulnerability detection (cybersecurity), primarily in the Java and C++ programming languages.
