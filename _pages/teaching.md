## Resources

In this section, I have curated resources that have been instrumental in my research. The aim is to provide valuable resources for those exploring these subjects independently.

### General Machine Learning & Theory

- Yandex's online [machine learning textbook](https://education.yandex.ru/handbook/ml) is designed for those who are not afraid of mathematics and want to delve into ML technologies, covering classical theory to cutting-edge topics, with new chapters to be added regularly.

- [A visual introduction to information theory](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-09-Visual-Information/). This post explores the fundamentals of information theory, including optimal encoding, entropy, cross-entropy, mutual information, and other essential concepts that underpin how machine learning models learn from data.

- [Matrix multiplication](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2015/visualizing-matrix-multiplication-as-a-linear-combination/) as two kinds of linear combinations (row-wise and column-wise).

- Different [upsampling techinques](https://mriquestions.com/upsampling.html) used in CNNs.

- [Grokking](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.02177): Generalization beyond overfitting on small algorithmic datasets.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)

- A wonderful [introductory course on NLP](https://lena-voita.github.io/nlp_course.html) from [Lena Voita](https://lena-voita.github.io/). It covers basic topics in a very beginner-friendly and visual format. Moreover, each chapter contains research-oriented questions that can inspire a reader to think about the learned material in novel ways.

- A nicely illustrated blog post about [transformers](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/) and [Seq2Seq models with attention](https://jalammar.github.io/visualizing-neural-machine-translation-mechanics-of-seq2seq-models-with-attention/) by [Jay Alammar](https://jalammar.github.io/). These posts can serve as a great entry point into the nuts and bolts of transformer-based models. His blog also contains some other well-visualized posts on machine learning topics.

- An [addon](https://lena-voita.github.io/nlp_course/models/convolutional.html) by Lena explaining Convolutional Neural Networks for text in more detail.
