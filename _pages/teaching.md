## Resources

In this section, I have curated resources that have been instrumental in my research. The aim is to provide valuable resources for those exploring these subjects independently.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)

- A wonderful [introductory course on NLP](https://lena-voita.github.io/nlp_course.html) from [Lena Voita](https://lena-voita.github.io/). It covers basic topics in a very beginner-friendly and visual format. Moreover, each chapter contains research-oriented questions that can inspire a reader to think about the learned material in novel ways;

- A nicely illustrated blog post about [transformers](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/) and [Seq2Seq models with attention](https://jalammar.github.io/visualizing-neural-machine-translation-mechanics-of-seq2seq-models-with-attention/) by [Jay Alammar](https://jalammar.github.io/). These posts can serve as a great entry point into the nuts and bolts of transformer-based models. His blog also contains some other well-visualized posts on machine learning topics;

- A [video course on NLP from Standford University](https://youtu.be/8rXD5-xhemo) (CS224N, Winter 2019). It can be used as a good theoretical introduction into the basics of NLP;

- [A visual introduction to information theory](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-09-Visual-Information/). This post explores the fundamentals of information theory, including optimal encoding, entropy, cross-entropy, mutual information, and other essential concepts that underpin how NLP models learn from data.
