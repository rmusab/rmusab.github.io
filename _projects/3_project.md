During my bachelor studies, I investigated the following research questions:

1. Can a single road intersection be effectively managed by a system based on reinforcement learning?
2. What would be the optimal choice of a model and a reward function to ensure the minimal congestion at the road intersection at all times?
3. What kind of real-time information would be enough for a model to learn the optimal behavior patterns?
4. How can we test this approach? Would a simulator be a good enough proxy to the real-world scenarios?
5. How can we extend this approach to a system of multiple road intersections?
